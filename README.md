## 1. Introduction & Problem Statement

### The Challenge
Educational institutions face significant challenges in managing examination seating arrangements:

- **Manual Process**: Traditional seating arrangements are done manually, consuming hours of administrative time
- **Human Errors**: Manual processes are prone to mistakes, leading to seating conflicts and unfair arrangements
- **Time Consumption**: Teachers and administrators spend valuable time on repetitive seating tasks
- **Cheating Prevention**: Static seating arrangements make it easier for students to plan cheating strategies
- **Scalability Issues**: Manual processes become increasingly difficult with larger student populations

### Our Solution
